n_1 = 'n ≈ 1. This suggests that the crystal\nembryos were pre-formed\n' \
    'and their growth\nввlimited to one dimension of spreading.\n' \
    'Also, this value often corresponds to\nthe surface distribution of nuclei and\nsaturation of these locations.'

n_2 = 'n ≈ 2. This suggests that the crystal\nembryos were pre-formed\n' \
    'and their growth\nlimited to two dimension of spreading.\nAlso, this value often corresponds to\n' \
    'the marginal distribution of embryos and\nthe saturation of these sites.'

n_3 = 'n ≈ 3. This suggests that the crystal\nembryos were pre-formed\n' \
    'and their growth\nlimited to two dimension of spreading.\n' \
    'Also, this value often corresponds to\nthe point distribution of embryos and\nthe saturation of these locations.'

n_4 = 'n ≈ 4. At this value, we can conclude\nthatthe transition ' \
    'has contributions \nfrom three growth dimensions,\nand another contribution \nis a constant nucleation rate.'

Workflow:\n\n  1. Click on the "+" button to upload files.\n   You can upload several files at the same time;
2. To delete a file from the calculation series,\n   click the delete button next to the file name;
3. Press the "Calculate" button to start calculations.\n\n
Comments:\n\n- Once the calculations have completed, a new window\n  will be opened with the results. The first windows
  will be devoted to calculations using\n  the Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mel-Avrami equation.
- If more than one file was transferred, the last two\n  tabs will be devoted to calculations by Friedman's 
  method and a summary page on the results\n  of Avrami calculation taking into account\n  all transferred files.
  Thus, it is recommended to simultaneously calculate\n  these parameters for single polymer\n  or type of experiment.
