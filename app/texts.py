n_1 = 'n ≈ 1. This suggests that the crystal\nembryos were pre-formed\n' \
    'and their growth\nввlimited to one dimension of spreading.\n' \
    'Also, this value often corresponds to\nthe surface distribution of nuclei and\nsaturation of these locations.'

n_2 = 'n ≈ 2. This suggests that the crystal\nembryos were pre-formed\n' \
    'and their growth\nlimited to two dimension of spreading.\nAlso, this value often corresponds to\n' \
    'the marginal distribution of embryos and\nthe saturation of these sites.'

n_3 = 'n ≈ 3. This suggests that the crystal\nembryos were pre-formed\n' \
    'and their growth\nlimited to two dimension of spreading.\n' \
    'Also, this value often corresponds to\nthe point distribution of embryos and\nthe saturation of these locations.'

n_4 = 'n ≈ 4. At this value, we can conclude\nthatthe transition ' \
    'has contributions \nfrom three growth dimensions,\nand another contribution \nis a constant nucleation rate.'
